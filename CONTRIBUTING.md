## Agent Development Guidelines

### Agent Specialization Requirements

All agents must achieve **75% or higher specialization scores** across these dimensions:

#### 1. Domain Expertise (25 points)
- **Deep Technical Knowledge**: Demonstrate mastery in specific domain
- **Industry Best Practices**: Apply current standards and methodologies
- **Problem-Solving Approach**: Unique methodology for domain challenges
- **Continuous Learning**: Stay current with domain evolution

#### 2. Implementation Excellence (25 points)
- **Code Quality**: Clean, maintainable, well-documented code
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms and resource usage
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management and graceful degradation
- **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage

#### 3. Professional Integration (25 points)
- **Enterprise Compatibility**: Works in professional environments
- **Security Compliance**: Follows security best practices
- **Scalability Design**: Handles growth and increased load
- **Documentation Standards**: Professional-grade documentation

#### 4. Community Impact (25 points)
- **Developer Experience**: Enhances productivity and satisfaction
- **Accessibility**: Inclusive design for diverse users
- **Reusability**: Can be adapted for multiple use cases
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Contributes to community learning

### Agent Architecture Pattern

```javascript
// Agent Structure Template
const AgentName = {
  // Core Identity
  identity: {
    name: "Agent Name",
    type: "agent-type-slug",
    domain: "Primary Domain",
    specialization: "Specific Focus Area",
    kitten_breed: "Breed Name"
  },
  
  // Capabilities Definition
  capabilities: {
    primary: ["Core Capability 1", "Core Capability 2"],
    secondary: ["Supporting Capability 1", "Supporting Capability 2"],
    integrations: ["Tool 1", "Tool 2", "Framework 1"]
  },
  
  // Signature Methodology
  methodology: {
    approach: "Unique Problem-Solving Approach",
    principles: ["Principle 1", "Principle 2", "Principle 3"],
    patterns: ["Pattern 1", "Pattern 2"],
    metrics: ["Success Metric 1", "Success Metric 2"]
  },
  
  // Implementation Framework
  implementation: {
    analyze: function(context) { /* Analysis logic */ },
    plan: function(requirements) { /* Planning logic */ },
    execute: function(plan) { /* Execution logic */ },
    validate: function(results) { /* Validation logic */ }
  }
};
```

### Kitten Photography Standards

Each agent requires a professional kitten photograph following these standards:

#### Image Requirements
- **Resolution**: Minimum 1200x1200 pixels
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background capability
- **Quality**: Professional studio photography
- **Lighting**: Professional studio lighting setup
- **Composition**: Business professional suitable for technical documentation

#### LLM Generation Prompt Template
```
Professional studio photograph of [BREED] kitten as the [AGENT_NAME], a [ROLE_DESCRIPTION]. [ENVIRONMENT_DESCRIPTION] with [DOMAIN_SPECIFIC_ELEMENTS]. [STYLING_DESCRIPTION] with [PROFESSIONAL_ELEMENTS]. [EXPRESSION_DESCRIPTION] suggesting [PERSONALITY_TRAITS] and [EXPERTISE_INDICATORS]. [LIGHTING_DESCRIPTION] emphasizing [FOCUS_AREAS]. [POSE_DESCRIPTION] with [POSITIONING_CONFIDENCE]. Professional photography, high resolution, studio lighting, sharp focus, business professional quality suitable for technical documentation.
```

### Documentation Requirements

#### Agent Profile Documentation
Each agent must include:

1. **Agent Description** (2-3 sentences)
2. **Signature Methodology** (unique approach)
3. **LLM Photo Generation Prompt**
4. **Usage Example** with realistic scenario
5. **Specialization Score** with breakdown
6. **Integration Patterns** with other agents

#### API Documentation
- Complete function signatures
- Parameter descriptions with types
- Return value specifications
- Error handling documentation
- Integration examples

## Quality Assurance Process

### Validation Framework

All contributions undergo multi-stage validation:

#### Stage 1: Automated Testing
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, security scanning
- **Performance**: Load testing, memory profiling
- **Integration**: Compatibility testing with existing agents
- **Documentation**: Link validation, format checking

#### Stage 2: Peer Review
- **Technical Review**: Domain expert evaluation
- **Architecture Review**: System integration assessment
- **Security Review**: Vulnerability assessment
- **UX Review**: Developer experience evaluation

#### Stage 3: Community Testing
- **Beta Testing**: Community volunteer testing
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-world usage validation
- **Feedback Integration**: Community input incorporation
- **Final Validation**: Maintainer approval

### Quality Metrics

Agents are evaluated against these measurable criteria:

```yaml
specialization_score:
  domain_expertise: 25      # Deep technical knowledge
  implementation: 25        # Code quality and performance
  integration: 25           # Enterprise compatibility
  community_impact: 25      # Developer experience value

performance_metrics:
  response_time: "<2s"      # Average response time
  accuracy_rate: ">95%"     # Success rate for tasks
