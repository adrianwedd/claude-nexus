# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a collection of specialized agent configurations for Claude Code's Task tool. Each agent is defined as a markdown file containing:

- Agent metadata (name, description, model)
- Specialized expertise and capabilities
- Structured methodologies and response formats
- Example usage scenarios

## Agent Architecture

The repository contains 16 specialized agents organized by domain expertise:

### Core Engineering Agents

- **reliability-engineer.md**: System architecture analysis, reliability engineering, issue grooming with comprehensive code inspection
- **code-sovereign.md**: Code quality assessment, architectural review, refactoring guidance, technical debt management
- **performance-virtuoso.md**: Performance optimization, bottleneck analysis, scalability improvements

### Infrastructure & Operations

- **deployment-commander.md**: Production-grade infrastructure deployment, CI/CD pipeline optimization, monitoring setup
- **cloud-navigator.md**: Cloud-native architecture design, Kubernetes optimization, multi-cloud strategy
- **devex-curator.md**: Developer workflow optimization, environment setup automation, team productivity

### Security & Quality

- **fortress-guardian.md**: Security analysis, vulnerability assessment, compliance validation
- **quality-assurance-engineer.md**: Testing strategy, quality assurance implementation, bug prevention

### Integration & Data

- **integration-maestro.md**: API integrations, resilience patterns, microservice communication
- **data-architect.md**: Data structures, schemas, content verification systems
- **data-flow-architect.md**: Backend system design, database optimization, data pipeline engineering

### User Experience & Documentation

- **interface-artisan.md**: Frontend development, UI/UX optimization, accessibility compliance
- **mobile-platform-specialist.md**: Mobile application development, cross-platform optimization
- **knowledge-curator.md**: Technical documentation, API references, knowledge management

### Advanced Capabilities

- **intelligence-orchestrator.md**: AI/ML integration, model deployment pipelines, responsible AI implementation
- **repository-surgeon.md**: Repository health assessment, technical debt elimination, project optimization

## Agent Configuration Format

Each agent follows a consistent YAML frontmatter structure:

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: Detailed description with usage examples
model: sonnet
---
```

Followed by specialized instructions including:

- Core operational principles
- Execution standards and methodology
- Problem-solving frameworks
- Response format specifications
- Domain-specific procedures

## Development Workflow

When working with agents:

1. Agents are invoked through the Task tool with the `subagent_type` parameter
2. Each agent operates independently with specialized knowledge
3. Agents provide structured outputs following their defined methodologies
4. No build, test, or lint commands are required for this configuration repository

## Agent Selection Guidelines

Choose agents based on task domain:

- **System reliability/architecture**: reliability-engineer
- **Code quality/refactoring**: code-sovereign  
- **Performance issues**: performance-virtuoso
- **Deployment/infrastructure**: deployment-commander, cloud-navigator
- **Security concerns**: fortress-guardian
- **API integrations**: integration-maestro
- **Frontend/UX work**: interface-artisan
- **Documentation needs**: knowledge-curator
